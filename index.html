      Scientists freeze the planet due to rising temperatures from climate change, causing the earth to become an uninhabitable ball of ice.

      A passenger plane flying from Sydney to Los Angeles crash-lands in the Pacific Ocean on a mysterious island. A group of survivors, all with demons in their past, must now band together in order to survive. The longer they remain, the more mysterious the island becomes, creating a rich, mind-bending narrative that questions the very nature of reality.
